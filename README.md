# EAGLET

EAGLET is a tool that supports the semi-automatic checking of a gold standard based on a set of uniform annotation rules. These set of rules are discussed in detail in the [paper](https://svn.aksw.org/papers/2017/ESWC_EAGLET_2017/public.pdf).

## Setup

* One just has to install Maven and EAGLET can be up and running. The instructions to install maven can be found [here](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html).

Once the maven is up and running. Clone the repository.

EAGLET is executed in the following two parts
1. Executing the Pipe
2. Executing the Service

**NOTE:**  Results Generated only from the pipe can be used in the Webservice. The pipe results can be generated by either executing the pipe or via the Service. 
### Executing The Pipe

This part of EAGLET is responsible for running the pipe. In order to exectute the pipe from the main java class execute the `runPipe.sh` file. Edit the file to add the location of the dataset
```
-Dexec.args="-n testdata -f <Location of File>"
```

The results are then generated in the folder `eaglet_data/result_pipe`.


### Executing The Service

The service can run pipe on the dataset or help user evaluate the dataset processed by the pipe from the previous step. The webservice can be executed by running the `runWebService.sh` file.

EAGLET should be running at a default port 8080. Web interface can be seen at 
```
http://localhost:8080/eaglet/login.html
```

* Add the dataset name and location in the UI to run the pipe.  The results are then generated in the folder `eaglet_data/result_pipe`.
* If one has already generated the dataset, one can just enter login and begin evaluating. 

## Configuring the pipe
The structure of the pipe can be configured from [here](https://github.com/dice-group/Eaglet/blob/master/src/main/resources/eaglet.properties#L35) in the `eaglet.properties` file.

## Result
Once the dataset(s) have been reviewed the results can be found in `eaglet_data/result_user/{username}` .
Detailed architecture is available in the demo [paper](https://svn.aksw.org/papers/2017/ESWC_EAGELT_DEMO/public.pdf)
